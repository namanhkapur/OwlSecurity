Keep your home and workplace secure!

Tomorrow you may fall in your home from a heart attack, the pasta your making may burst into flames, and a burglar may enter your home with a gun what will you do, better yet what can you do?"

Sawano is an advanced camera based security system that uses bleeding edge API integration, image recognition technology, and machine learning to detect security hazards and automatically work to resolve them. Sawano can independently resolve security hazards in real time without human interaction. However, users may enter emergency contact information to be texted with the cause of emergency, a picture of the emergency, a date stamp, and a time stamp. Sawano allows users to replace what could potentially be dozens of individually purchased security systems with a single package and an old smart phone.
